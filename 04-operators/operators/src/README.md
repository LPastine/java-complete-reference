# Chapter 4 - Operators

Java provides a rich operator environment. Most of its operators can be divided
into the following four groups:

- Arithmetic
- Bitwise
- Relational
- Logical

Java also defines some additional operators that handle certain special situations.
This chapter describes all of Java's operators except for the type comparison
operator **instanceof** and the arrow operator (->), which are described, in
other chapters.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way they
are used in algebra.
